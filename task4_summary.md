# Task 4 Implementation Summary

## Objective
Simplify and fix entity platform implementations by:
- Reducing sensor definitions to core parameters only
- Removing complex error handling and state preservation from entities
- Fixing entity unique IDs and device associations
- Ensuring entities use standard Home Assistant patterns

## Changes Made

### 1. Sensor Platform (sensor.py)
**Before**: 
- 7 core sensors + 12 system diagnostic sensors + 10 diagnostic sensors = 29 total entities
- Complex error handling with state preservation, grace periods, and health monitoring
- Extensive diagnostic attributes and error tracking

**After**:
- 3 core sensors only: `in-a:voltage`, `in-b:voltage`, `fan:rpm`
- Simple value parsing with basic error handling
- Standard Home Assistant entity patterns
- Removed all diagnostic and system sensors

### 2. Switch Platform (switch.py)
**Before**:
- 15 switch entities including PWM controls and advanced features
- Complex state preservation and error handling
- Extensive retry logic and health monitoring

**After**:
- 10 core switches: fan, power rails (12V, 24V-A, 24V-B), and output enables (A-F)
- Simple state parsing (true/false, 1/0, on/off, enabled/disabled)
- Basic error handling with standard Home Assistant exceptions
- Removed PWM-specific switches (will be added back in later phases)

### 3. Number Platform (number.py)
**Before**:
- 54 number entities including PWM controls, calibration, and thresholds
- Complex error handling with retry logic and state preservation
- Extensive validation and diagnostic features

**After**:
- 6 core voltage controls: `out-a:voltage` through `out-f:voltage`
- Simple voltage range (0-10V) with 0.01V step
- Basic value clamping and error handling
- Removed all calibration, PWM, and threshold controls

### 4. Fan Platform (fan.py)
**Before**:
- Complex fan entity with speed presets, duty cycle management, and health monitoring
- Extensive error handling and state preservation
- Advanced PWM control features

**After**:
- Simple fan entity with basic on/off and percentage control
- Standard Home Assistant fan entity patterns
- Basic error handling without complex retry logic
- Uses simple `fan:enabled` and `fan:duty-cycle` parameters

## Entity Definitions Summary

| Platform | Count | Keys |
|----------|-------|------|
| Sensors | 3 | `in-a:voltage`, `in-b:voltage`, `fan:rpm` |
| Switches | 10 | `fan:enabled`, `switch-12v:enabled`, `switch-24v-a:enabled`, `switch-24v-b:enabled`, `out-a:enabled` through `out-f:enabled` |
| Numbers | 6 | `out-a:voltage` through `out-f:voltage` |
| Fan | 1 | Fan control entity |

## Key Improvements

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed complex error handling, state preservation, and health monitoring
2. **Standard Patterns**: All entities now follow standard Home Assistant entity patterns
3. **Consistent Unique IDs**: All entities use format `{config_entry_id}_{key}` or `{config_entry_id}_fan`
4. **Proper Device Association**: All entities properly link to device info
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed 70+ entities down to 20 core entities
6. **Better Maintainability**: Code is much simpler and easier to understand
7. **Faster Loading**: Fewer entities should improve integration loading time

## Verification

- All Python files compile without errors
- Entity definitions follow expected patterns
- Complex error handling patterns removed
- Standard Home Assistant entity patterns implemented
- Unique IDs are consistent and properly formatted

## Next Steps

This simplified implementation provides the foundation for the integration to work reliably. Advanced features like PWM controls, calibration parameters, and diagnostic entities can be added back incrementally in later phases once the core functionality is proven to work.
