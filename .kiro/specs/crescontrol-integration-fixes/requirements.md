# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CresControl Home Assistant integration currently has critical issues preventing proper functionality. Users report that not all sensors and values are visible in Home Assistant, and the integration fails to load properly in HACS/Home Assistant OS environments. This feature addresses these core functionality problems to ensure the integration works reliably across all deployment scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want the CresControl integration to load successfully in HACS and Home Assistant OS, so that I can install and use the integration without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is installed via HACS THEN the integration SHALL load without Python import errors
2. WHEN the integration is loaded in Home Assistant OS THEN all required dependencies SHALL be available and functional
3. WHEN the integration starts up THEN it SHALL not cause Home Assistant to fail or become unstable
4. WHEN the integration is configured THEN the config flow SHALL complete successfully without exceptions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CresControl device owner, I want to see all available sensors from my device in Home Assistant, so that I can monitor all aspects of my grow environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration connects to a CresControl device THEN it SHALL expose analog input sensors for in-a:voltage and in-b:voltage
2. WHEN the integration polls the device THEN it SHALL expose fan sensors for enabled state, duty cycle, minimum duty cycle, and RPM
3. WHEN the integration queries the device THEN it SHALL expose all analog output sensors (A-F) showing enabled state and voltage values
4. WHEN the device supports PWM outputs THEN it SHALL expose PWM-specific sensors for duty cycle and frequency on supported channels
5. WHEN the device has auxiliary switches THEN it SHALL expose sensors for 12V, 24V-A, and 24V-B rail states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CresControl device owner, I want to control all available outputs and switches from Home Assistant, so that I can manage my grow environment remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is configured THEN it SHALL expose switch entities for fan enable/disable control
2. WHEN the integration connects THEN it SHALL expose switch entities for all auxiliary power rails (12V, 24V-A, 24V-B)
3. WHEN the device supports analog outputs THEN it SHALL expose switch entities for enabling/disabling each output channel (A-F)
4. WHEN the device supports PWM THEN it SHALL expose switch entities for enabling/disabling PWM on supported channels
5. WHEN a user toggles a switch THEN the device state SHALL update immediately and be reflected in Home Assistant

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CresControl device owner, I want to set precise voltage and duty cycle values for outputs, so that I can fine-tune my grow environment controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration connects THEN it SHALL expose number entities for setting analog output voltages (A-F) with 0.01V precision
2. WHEN the device supports PWM THEN it SHALL expose number entities for setting duty cycle percentages (0-100%)
3. WHEN the device supports PWM THEN it SHALL expose number entities for setting PWM frequency values within device limits
4. WHEN a user changes a number value THEN the device SHALL update immediately and the new value SHALL be confirmed
5. WHEN setting values THEN the integration SHALL validate ranges and provide appropriate error messages for invalid inputs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant administrator, I want the CresControl integration to handle network issues gracefully, so that temporary connectivity problems don't cause system instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device becomes temporarily unreachable THEN the integration SHALL continue operating with cached data
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the integration SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. WHEN the device recovers from network issues THEN the integration SHALL automatically reconnect and resume normal operation
4. WHEN persistent connectivity issues occur THEN the integration SHALL log appropriate diagnostic information
5. WHEN WebSocket connectivity fails THEN the integration SHALL gracefully fall back to HTTP polling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration code to follow Home Assistant best practices, so that it passes validation and works reliably in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is analyzed THEN it SHALL follow Home Assistant integration development guidelines
2. WHEN the integration is loaded THEN it SHALL properly handle async operations without blocking the event loop
3. WHEN entities are created THEN they SHALL have proper unique IDs and device associations
4. WHEN the integration shuts down THEN it SHALL properly clean up resources and connections
5. WHEN configuration changes occur THEN the integration SHALL handle reloads gracefully without memory leaks
